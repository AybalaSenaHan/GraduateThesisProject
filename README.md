# GraduateThesisProject

In our database we have eight tables as
-	Thesis Table
-	Type Table
-	Language Table
-	Subject Table
-	University Table
-	Author Table
-	Supervisor Table
-	Institute Table
In Thesis table we are taking other tables ID’s as attribute by this means we can access and take their attributes too.


We create a form application in C#.

- In our application we have a main page. It has three different buttons.
- When we click the ‘Admin Panel’ button it opens admin login panel which asks admin name and password. 
- When we click login with correct username and password it opens admin panel.
- On admin panel we can add/delete/update university, institute, type, language and subject names.
- On main page when we click ‘Author Interface’ it opens a window which has new or registered author buttons.
- When we click ‘New Author’ it opens a window which takes some informations about author and his/her supervisor(s).
- When we click ‘Author Interface’ from this window or ‘Registered Author’ button from ‘PreAuthorInterface’ it opens ‘Author Interface’ window which takes information of thesis.
- Author can add thesis from this window.
- On main page if we click ‘Detail Search’ button it opens detail search window.
